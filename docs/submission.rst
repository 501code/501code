Project Submission & Approval
-----------------------------
Anyone registered can submit a project on behalf of a non-profit organisation. The project can
be anything ranging from a website, web application to mobile applications.

Once a submitted project is reviewed a Github repository will be created for it on the `501code Github account. <http://501code.org/>`_ It is important that users give in-depth
descriptions of the projects and the issues they are facing.

Projects don't have to be started from scratch, they can be existing projects like an old website that could
use a modern look, or a broken mobile app et cetera.
